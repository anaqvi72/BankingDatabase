# BankingDatabase

## Introduction
###The purpose of this system is to track information about various banks and their branches, as well as the customers they serve and the accounts those customers create within the bank. Banks should be able to input customer information and transaction reports, then receive information about accrued income based off of interest rates. Managers should be able to input management reports of accounts and loans then receive account and loan requests. Corporations should use this database to input transaction information and receive the necessary funds from the appropriate customer accounts. Finally, customers should be able to use this database to request transactions and view the statements as a result of these transactions. This system is currently designed for a set of local bank systems, and does not support more than one routing number per bank entity.
